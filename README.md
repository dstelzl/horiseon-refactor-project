# Horiseon Refactor Project

## Description
 Altered site for better SEO and accessibility using modifications to HTML and CSS files. 
 
 The original HTML file was segmented primarily by non-semantic div tags. Those tags were replaced with apropriated semantic tags indicating the segment's usage on the page. The title of the HTML file was modified to incorporate key words for better internet searchability. All images were provided with alt attributes describing the image for accessibility.
 
 The CSS file was refactored by eliminating duplicate styles and changing style names to be more generic to include all of the elements affected.

 This README was created to reflect the changes made to the project.
